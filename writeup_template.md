### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.



|   i   | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i) | theta(i) |
| :---: | :--------: | :----: | :--: | :------: |
| **1** |            |        |      |          |
| **2** |            |        |      |          |
| **3** |            |        |      |          |
| **4** |            |        |      |          |
| **5** |            |        |      |          |
| **6** |            |        |      |          |
| **7** |            |        |      |          |



#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

| Here's |      A      |  Snappy  | Table |
| ------ | :---------: | :------: | :---: |
| 1      | `highlight` | **bold** | 7.41  |
| 2      |      a      |    b     |   c   |
| 3      |  *italic*   |   text   |  403  |
| 4      |      2      |    3     | abcd  |

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results.
